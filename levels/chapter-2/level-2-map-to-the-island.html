The water in front of you starts to bubble, and suddenly dries up, leaving a gravel floor for you to traverse. As you walk through the river with a wall of water on both sides, you can’t help yourself from opening your mouth in wonder. A large orange fish swims even with you, followed by a smaller blue one, and by the time you cross the river more than a dozen colorful river-fish accompany you on either side. It warms your heart, even if just for the moment.<br/><br/>But you cross the river, the water floods back into its place, and the moment ends. You journey to the port-city of Addithia, where you hope to gather more information about the goblins. You are still following the path of footprints, but they grow fainter and fainter as the ground you run on becomes less muddy and more dry. You arrive at Addithia as the sun meets the horizon and the sky begins to darken. You can no longer see any footprints but to the north, beyond the well-kept wooden docks, you see a ship setting sail with the goblin’s signature sword-handle proudly displayed on its sail. Here you sleep for the night and prepare for the following day’s journey.<br/><br/>In the morning, you inquire the local villagers about the goblin’s destination. One of them claimed to have heard of a “Goblin Island,” but could not recall any other details. Another said they’ve once seen a map to the Goblins, but couldn’t remember where they saw it. Finally, they met a sailor with graying golden hair and a large frame who vaguely said, “Aye. I lived there once.” After saying this he looked down back at his rope and tied a knot in it.<br/><br/>“Can you show me the way?” you ask, hopeful that this stranger was telling the truth. “They took something immensely potent from my village—a spell book—and they could do great evil with the powers contained in that book.”<br/><br/>“I escaped Goblin Island with my ship when I was a young child. There was a map inside of the boat, painted on a beautiful piece of parchment, but it was since destroyed in a fire. I have no intention of returning.”<br/><br/>“Well… I might be able to do something about that map.” You hope that your magic bookmark can save you from this situation.<br/><br/>He (skeptically) lays the parchment in front of you, and you see the strokes of ink decorate what once was a burnt map. You open your own spell book and find the bookmark in a new place. <br/><br/>The lemma is titled “add_succ” and it teaches you an important prerequisite to commutative property, which is a very powerful spell. Prove “add_succ”, cast the spell, and restore the map!<br/><br/>                                </p>
